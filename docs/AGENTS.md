# AGENT NOTES FOR DUBLIN CLEANERS TRAINING APP

- Scope: everything inside `/docs`.
- Keep docs concise, actionable, and written for internal trainers.
- Use bullet lists and stepwise instructions when possible.
- Assume trainers know Google Sheets and Apps Script basics.
- Highlight how Training Leads can use the Admin View to see who is certified (open Admin View → Load Summary → filter by employee name and Certified? column).
- Explain the dashboard cues: progress bar shows modules completed out of five plus estimated minutes; module checklist badges show ✅ for completed and ❌ for missing.
- Note that Module 5 covers escalation and tailor-only handoffs; reassure staff that certification requires all five modules and the same calculation used in the ModuleResults sheet.
